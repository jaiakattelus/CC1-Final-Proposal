# CC1-Final-Proposal
For my final project I will be working on a Volleyball game. I've been messing around with the idea in my free time but this is sort of an excuse to put some more time into the project. So far it's just a 1 on 1, 2-d game. It controls something like a two person arcade fighter with P1 controlling with wasd and P2 controlling with the arrow keys. A big inspiration for this project is "Super Volleyball", made for the super nintendo in 1986. There is also the very popular "Spike Volleyball," similar in 2d design but with clearer graphics than i may be able to create. I am going to struggle with the background and character design as these are things im not very comfortable with and dont have the means to do well, I really like the idea of an 8bit design like in "Super Volleyball." I plan to work on this project for a couple hours a day until the deadline,. I'm not super concerned with running out of time at this point since this is something i've got the base layers coded for already. The main controls are built, I just need to work on a serve system for starting each match point.
